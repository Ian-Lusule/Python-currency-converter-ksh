This code provides a single conversion example for the `python-currency-converter-ksh` project.  It assumes you have already created the core currency converter functionality (which would involve fetching exchange rates from an API and performing conversions).  This example focuses on reading a conversion request from a file and handling potential errors.

# Example usage (replace with your actual API key)
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"  
process_single_conversion("examples/single_conversion.txt", API_KEY)

```

Remember to replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual API key from exchangerate-api.com (or a similar service).  This improved version includes more robust error handling and clarifies the conversion logic.  You'll need to adapt the `convert` method to handle conversions that don't involve USD as an intermediary if your API doesn't provide direct cross-rates for all currency pairs.  Consider adding more sophisticated error logging and reporting for a production-ready application.
